Rick takes Morty flying above the town at night, binge-drinking heavily]
Rick: What do you— what do you think of this f-flying vehicle, Morty? I built it out of stuff I found in the garage.
Morty: Yeah, Rick, it's... it's great. Is this the surprise?
Rick: Morty... I had to— I had to do ih... I had t— I had— I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb.
Morty: What?! A bomb?!
Rick: We're gonna drop it down there, just... get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start.
Morty: Th-th-th-that's absolutely crazy!
Rick: Come on, Morty, just take it easy, Morty, it's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica.
Morty: Jessica? From my math class?
Rick: When I drop the bomb, I wa— [chugs booze] Y'know, I want you to have somebody, y'know... I want you to have the thing—I'm gonna make you like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam—
Morty: Hohh!
Rick: And Jessica's gonna be Eve. [Morty croaks out] That's-that's the surprise, Morty.
Morty: No, you can't! J-Jessica doesn't even know I exist! But-but-but-but, forget about that because... you can't blow up humanity!
Rick: I-I get what you're trying to say, M-Morty. Listen, I'm not your— you don't gotta worry about me tryin' to... fool around w-with Jessica... mess around with Jessica or anything, I'm... I'm not that kinda guy, Morty.
Morty: What're you talking about, Rick?!
Rick: You-you-you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. She... she-she-she-she's all for you, Morty.
Morty: I don't care about Jessica!! Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Ye...
Rick: Y'know what, Morty, you're right. Let's forget the girl altogether, sh-she's probably nothing but trouble anyways. [presses button]
Voice: "Arming neutrino bomb."
Morty: That's it! That's it, Rick! I'm taking the wheel!
Rick: Get off— get offa me, Morty! Come on!
Morty: I'm taking charge of the situation, buddy!
Rick: Wha-what's gotten into you?!
Morty: I'm-I'm pooped!
Rick: If you love her so much, why don't you... marry her?!
Morty: I'm-I'm not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb-dumb—
Rick: What're you, crazy?!
Morty: ..person and just let y-you blow up the whole world!
Rick: Alright, alright, Morty! Alright, alright, I'll... I'll land, I'll land, I'll land, I'll land the thing, I'll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.
Rick: [shoots portal] There she is. Alright, c'mon, Morty, let's go.
Morty: Oh jeez... okay. [...] Oh man, Rick! What is this place?
Rick: It's Dimension 35C, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of— TREE, Morty! Called the Megatree! And there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about Megaseeds, th—ther—they're incredib-bl-ly powerful and I need 'em to help them with my research, Morty.
Morty: Oh man, Rick! I'm looking around this place and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing!
Rick: Alright, alright, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You lookin' around and it's all scary and different, but y'know... m-meeting them head-on, charging into 'em like a bull—that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations, I deal with them all the time. Now if you just stick with me, Morty— [a horrific alien monstrosity approaches behind] we're gonna be— HOLY CRAP, MORTY, RUN!! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE, MORTY, RUN!! I KNOW, I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT THING BEFORE IN MY LIFE, MORTY, I DUNNO WHAT THE HELL IT IS!! WELL, WE GOTTA GET HERE, MORTY, IT GONNA KILL US!!! WE'RE GONNA DIE!!! WE'RE GONNA DIE, MORTY!!!
Beth: I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to... grab him and... stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?!
Jerry: I told you, I was ordering you something for Valentine's Day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son! [a hunky vet stops by]
Davin: Everything cool in here, Beth?
Beth: It's fine, Davin.
Davin: Okay, cool. Y'know, we did something great today. There's nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse.
[beat, Jerry closes door]
Jerry: Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies.
Morty: Holy cow, Rick! I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter!
Rick: Full disclosure, Morty — it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the Megaseeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.
Morty: Aw, man!
Rick: Yeah. And once those seeds weahh-wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills and... you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty. [checks arm watches] Starting ruh-ight about now.
Morty: Ohh, man! Ohh, ohhh geez!! Ohh... [falls down]
Rick: I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come. And I needed those seeds real bad and I have to give 'em up just to get your parents off my back! So now we're gonna have to go get more! And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty. And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty! Because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty! But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of 'em. And together we're gonna run around, Morty, we're gonna- do all of kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty.
Morty: [gurgling] No, no, no....
Rick: The outside world is our enemy, Morty! We're the only fehh-friends we got, Morty! It's just Rick and Morty! Ruh-ick and Morty and their adventures, Morty! Rick and Morty forever and forever, 100 years, Rick and Morty's things! Me and Rick and Morty running around and... Rick and Morty time! All day long, forever... all- a hundred days! Rick and Morty forever a hundred times! Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. Www.rickandmorty.com. Www.rickandmortyadventures. All 100 years. Every minute, rickandmorty.com.
